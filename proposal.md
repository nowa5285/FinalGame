# Through the Looking Glass

## Concept
In **Through the Looking Glass**, you play as a character navigating parallel worlds, each with unique physics and challenges connected by “mirrors” or portals. Each world affects your character differently—gravity shifts, time distortions, or dimension swaps. Armed with a mysterious mirror shard, you can switch between worlds by “reflecting” (using an in-game button) to evade enemies, solve puzzles, or reach hidden areas.

## Mechanics

1. **Dual-World Mechanic**
   - Toggle between two parallel worlds to solve platform puzzles.
   - In one world, platforms may be solid; in the other, they’re transparent, allowing the player to drop down or move freely through certain areas.

2. **Reflective Abilities**
   - Some enemies and obstacles can only be defeated in a specific world, requiring strategic timing of world-switches.
   - Different power-ups exist in each world, so players must toggle between worlds to gain specific skills.

3. **Light and Shadow Puzzles**
   - Some levels feature light mechanics where players reflect light beams to unlock paths.
   - Moving in and out of shadows to avoid detection or activate specific platforms adds stealth and puzzle-solving elements.

4. **Narrative Progression**
   - The player is trying to piece together memories, with each world revealing parts of their past.
   - Unlocking new worlds grants new abilities based on memories, like double-jumping, wall-sliding, or temporarily slowing time to reach difficult areas.

5. **Dynamic Art Style**
   - Each world has a contrasting art style to signify when switching is needed.
   - For example, one world might have a neon-lit cyberpunk style, while another has a foggy, gothic aesthetic, enhancing both immersion and visual cues for gameplay.

## Summary
"Through the Looking Glass" combines puzzle-platforming and strategic world-switching with a narrative about memory and identity. The mechanics and contrasting art styles create a deeply immersive experience where each world holds secrets and challenges unique to its theme.
